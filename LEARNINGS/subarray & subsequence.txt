1. Subarray sum equals k


[a, b, c, d, e, f]

Neetcode

use prefix_sums to get the new sub array sum

eg: sub array cde = k
=> sub array cde = abcde - ab 
and ab is already stored in prefix sums because we already visited integer


this technique of using the previously visited & computed values can also be seen in other places like in sliding window
Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Input: s = "zxyzxyz"
Output: 3
Explanation: The string "xyz" is the longest without duplicate characters.

we store the index of the characters already visited and left_max_idx variable, which keeps track of the left most duplicate character idx

once we know that, we just do curr_idx - left_max_idx for the length of the string without duplicates

whenever you are thinking that you need to look ahead for the same character / int, etc., instead keep traversing and then look back because you will already have data of the things you traversed and calculated


Longest Repeating Character Replacement
this as well, instead of looking ahead when the non-matching values will come, calculate and lookbehind when we cross that k value
