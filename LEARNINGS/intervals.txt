intervals = [1, 3], [4, 6], newIntervals = [2, 5]

new Inteval = [2, 5], on the left side is less than interval, on the right side is more than interval
interval could be [1, 3], or [4, 6] (interating)

interval[0] <= newInterval[0] <= interval[1] or interval[0] <= newInterval[1] <= interval[1]

(1 <= 2 <= 3) satisfies this condition of overlap
(4 <= 5 <= 6) satisfies this condition of overlap


Sorting:

    1. Sort by start → when you want to merge or detect overlap forward

        1. You only need to compare each interval with the previous merged one.
        2. You don’t need to look backward
        3. One pass is enough
        4. "If an interval overlaps, it must overlap with the previous one."
        5. Because all earlier intervals start even earlier — so if they didn’t overlap, they’re already merged.

    2. Sort by end → when you want to greedily select maximum non-overlapping intervals OR (Minimize removals)
