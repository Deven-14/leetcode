intervals = [1, 3], [4, 6], newIntervals = [2, 5]

new Inteval = [2, 5], on the left side is less than interval, on the right side is more than interval
interval could be [1, 3], or [4, 6] (interating)

interval[0] <= newInterval[0] <= interval[1] or interval[0] <= newInterval[1] <= interval[1]

(1 <= 2 <= 3) satisfies this condition of overlap
(4 <= 5 <= 6) satisfies this condition of overlap


For, Non-overlapping Intervals, sort by end and compare prev_interval.end > interval.start to find minimum overlapping intervals
